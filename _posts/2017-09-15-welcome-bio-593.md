The class "BIO 593: Special topics in R" is an outgrowth of the [rhodyRstats](https://rhodyrstats.org) study group meetings.  In those meetings we had guest speaekers present on a variety of R topics and packages.  This course builds on this format.  We will work in groups and each group will develop a presentation on an R topic chosen by the class.  Each group will be responsible for developing the materials (as an R Markdown document) and then presenting those materials in class.  During the first class we will introduce R Markdown, the format required for submitting your presentation materials and we will set the schedule for the rest of the semester.

For the nitty gritty details of the class, please look at the [syllabus](https://rhodyrstats.github.io/special_topics_in_r/syllabus.html) (still a work in progress) and the [schedule of presentations](https://rhodyrstats.github.io/special_topics_in_r/schedule.html)
